#Project Title:
*Team: 1987 Minnesota Twins
*Reason: I have awesome childhood memories of this team.

#Instructions:

Pick your favorite team (sports or otherwise) and create an object with 10 properties and a function that pretty prints the values.



#Output:

The 1987 Minnesota Twins were the World Champions. The manager was Tom Kelly. The star players included Kent Hrbek, Kirby Puckett and Bert Blyleven. The Twins played their home games in the Metrodome, also known as Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome. Everyone in the building would wave a Homer Hanky and shout 'Go Twins!'.
